# EXERCISE 1.16: CLOUD DEPLOYMENT
I used the website render.com to deploy the docker container.  
After signing up, I created a new "Web Service".   
After entering the public Git repository URL https://github.com/HoffmannTom/leaky
and pressing "continue", render.com automatically recognized the dockerfile and only needed a name, where I chose "leaky".
Additionally, I changed the region to "Frankfurt (EU central)".

The dockerfile is also submitted to the project:  
https://github.com/HoffmannTom/leaky/blob/main/Dockerfile  

The application is now accessible via the URL:  
https://leaky.onrender.com/
